Hack for Savannah
=================

## Local Development
If you want to make significant changes to the site, it's recommended you do so on your local machine first so as to speed up the development process. Here's how to do that.

### Requirements
* [Ruby 1.9.3 or later](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Text Editor

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/code4sac/codeforsacramento.org.git`

#### Install Dependencies
`bundle`

#### Build the Pages
`jekyll build`

#### Serve the Pages
`jekyll serve --watch`

### Hack Away

With `jekyll serve --watch` running, you should be able to access the site on [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)! Thanks to the `--watch` flag, any changes you make to the markdown (md) files will update automatically!

For reference, here's an [awesome markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).
